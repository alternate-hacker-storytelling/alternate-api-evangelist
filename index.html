title: About Alternate API Evangelist
overview: true
---

<p>While immersed in a world of technology, reading and writing about real-world technologies, I needed an outlet, somewhere I could publish my fictional thoughts and stories. I find it easier to get back to the every day grind of tech blogging, if I have a place to produce fictional work. So I created an alternate reality where I can blog about the weird shit, I think I see every day.</p>
<p>Nothing you read at alternate.apievangelist.com is real, if you are looking for my non-fiction work visit <a href="http://kinlane.com/">Kin Lane</a> or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a></p>
